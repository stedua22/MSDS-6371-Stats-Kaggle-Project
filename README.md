# MSDS-6371-Stats-Kaggle-Project

## Project Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this Kaggle competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or the presence of a white-picket fence!

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

The entire process will be done in R and SAS. SAS is used for the first analysis question and variable selection.
