# MSDS-6371-Stats-Kaggle-Project

## Project Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this Kaggle competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or the presence of a white-picket fence!

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

The entire process will be done in R and SAS. SAS is used for the first analysis question and variable selection.

## Data Description
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock, and is available to download via Kaggle.com. While the entire training data set examines 1460 observations of 79 different variables of home ownership in Ames, Iowa, for example, square footage, lot size, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, etc, more information about all the variables can be found on the Kaggle website. For the first analysis we focused on what our client, Century 21, is interested in, which includes how the sales price of a home is related to the square footage of the living area of the house  and if the SalesPrice (and its relationship to square footage) depends on which neighborhood the house is located in the three neighborhoods they sell in, which are the NAmes, Edwards, and BrkSide neighborhoods. For the second analysis, we will consider all neighborhoods and we conducted four separate types of regression stepwise, forward, and backward, and a custom model.
